```

## Pre-run configuration

The user who runs the script must have read-write permissions to the following `/etc/swanctl/` folders:

- bliss
- ecdsa
- pkcs12
- pkcs8
- private
- pubkey
- rsa
- x509
- x509aa
- x509ac
- x509ca
- x509crl
- x509ocsp

It may be convenient to have a group and assign the appropriate ACL rules (requires the filesystem to support this) to avoid running the script as root.

For group `cert-manager`, this could be done like this:
```bash
for dir in bliss ecdsa pkcs12 pkcs8 private pubkey rsa x509 x509aa x509ac x509ca x509crl x509ocsp
do
    sudo setfacl -m g:cert-manager:rwx /etc/swanctl/$dir;
    sudo setfacl -dm g:cert-manager:rw /etc/swanctl/$dir;
done
```
